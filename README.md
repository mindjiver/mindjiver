### Hi there 👋

Hi there, I have been bridging the gap between development and operations for nearly twenty years and have a passion for developing and operating distributed systems that run with minimal issues. My experience spans embedded systems to large-scale Internet systems, always prioritizing high site reliability and backend development with a focus on operability. I enjoy working with distributed systems, system languages, and the warm, fuzzy feeling that comes with complete automation.

Primarily working remote but also available for semi-remote roles in northern Germany. 💻🏂🇸🇪❤💃🇩🇪🐒🎉💻
