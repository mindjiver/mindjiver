### Hi there 👋

I have been crossing the boundaries between development and operations for over ten years. I love building infrastructure and distributed systems that run without problems. I would love to help out making your back-end applications run better and your infrastructure easier to manage. Primarily working remote but also available for semi-remote roles in northern Germany. 💻🏂🇸🇪❤💃🇩🇪🐒🎉💻
